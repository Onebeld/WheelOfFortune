# Wheel Of Fortune
This is a quiz game in which you have to guess the word by choosing letters. It is similar to the TV program Wheel Of Fortune, as well as the Russian TV program Field of Miracles. Was developed as part of the Scripting Languages discipline at the university.

The game is written in pure JavaScript, thus I decided to test myself on what I was capable of.
